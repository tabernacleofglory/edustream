### **1. Getting Started**

#### **How do I sign up?**

#### **Why is it important to complete my profile?**
After you first log in, you will be directed to the **Settings** page. Completing your profile is essential. It ensures you are placed in the correct "Class Ladder," which unlocks the courses appropriate for your level. It also helps us connect you with a prayer group (HP) if you're not already in one.

#### **What is the Dashboard?**
The Dashboard is your personal homepage. Here you can:

### **2. Courses & Learning**

#### **How do I find and enroll in courses?**
- Go to the **All Courses** page from the main menu.
- Here, you will see all the courses available to you based on your current Class Ladder.
- Click on a course to preview its content, and click the "Enroll" button to start learning.

#### **What are "Class Ladders"?**
Class Ladders are the structured learning paths on our platform. You start at the "New Member" ladder and progress upwards by completing all the required courses in your current ladder. This ensures a logical and sequential learning journey.

#### **How is my course progress tracked?**
Your progress is tracked automatically as you watch videos. A course is considered complete only when you have:
1.  Watched all the videos in the course.
2.  Successfully passed all the required quizzes for that course.

#### **How do quizzes work?**
Some courses have quizzes to test your knowledge. You must achieve the minimum passing score (usually 70%, but it can vary) to pass. Passing all quizzes is required for course completion.
